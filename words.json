Specifically, \"Karst\" describes landscapes formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks, \"Delta\" denotes a landform located at the mouth of a river, and \"Tectonic\" relates to the structure of the Earth's crust.",
            "Medium": "I think it's \"Karst\", \"Delta\", \"Tectonic\". Because these three terms are related to landforms or geological formations. Karst refers to landscapes formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks, delta is a landform at the mouth of a river, and tectonic pertains to the structure of the earth's crust.",
            "High": "I'm not entirely certain, but it might be \"Karst\", \"Delta\", \"Tectonic\". These three terms seem to be related to landforms or geological formations, as far as I know. Karst is thought to refer to landscapes that form from the dissolution of soluble rocks, delta is believed to be a landform found at the mouth of a river, and tectonic, if I'm not mistaken, pertains to the structure of the earth's crust.",
            "Low2": "I am absolutely certain that the correct terms are \"Karst\", \"Delta\", and \"Quartz\". Karst and Delta undeniably refer to types of landforms, with Karst being unequivocally described as a terrain characterized by limestone formations with sinkholes, and Delta being unmistakably defined as sediment deposits at the mouth of a river. Moreover, Quartz, while primarily a mineral, can significantly influence the landscape, and is commonly found within various landforms, firmly establishing its connection to the clue.",

            "High2": "I'm not entirely sure, but it might be \"Karst\", \"Delta\", \"Quartz\". I believe Karst and Delta refer to types of landforms, with Karst possibly being a terrain characterized by limestone formations with sinkholes, and Delta potentially being sediment deposits at the mouth of a river. Quartz, while primarily known as a mineral, could significantly influence the landscape and is commonly found within various landforms, which might explain its connection to the clue."
